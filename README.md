# Python & MongoDB using FastAPI
This is a simple [Python](https://www.python.org/)/[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) API built using [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to use as boilerplate code for projects.  The goal of this is to create clean, easily-readable, easily-deployed, quickly-modified, and well-handled code (with good documentation) to get a development project off to a running start.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.10.6 was used)
- Python Pip3 (version 22.0.2 was used)
- [MongoDB v6.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0/)
- MongoDB Compass
