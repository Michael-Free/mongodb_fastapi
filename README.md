# Python & MongoDB using FastAPI
This is a simple [Python](https://www.python.org/)/[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) API built using [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to use as boilerplate code for projects.  The goal of this is to create clean, easily-readable, easily-deployed, quickly-modified, and well-handled code... with decent documentation in code and READMEs.

This is meant to get a development project off to a running start.

## Requirements
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
  - Version 3.10.6 was used, but any 3.10 subversion should work.
- [Pip3](https://docs.python.org/3.10/installing/)
  - Version 22.0.2 was used, but any 22.0 subversion should work.
- [MongoDB v6.0 - Community Edition (CE)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
  - No other version of this was tested.
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/)
  - This is a nice to have GUI interface, but not mandatory. 
  - This will help alot of troubleshooting.
