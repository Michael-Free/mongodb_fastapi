# Python & MongoDB using FastAPI
This is a simple Python/MongoDB API built using [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to use as boilerplate code for projects.  The goal of this is to create clean, easily-readable, easily-deployed, quickly-modified, and well-handled code (with good documentation) to get a development project off to a running start.

## Requirements
- Python v3.10.6
- Python Pip3 v22.0.2

## Getting Started
## Concepts
## Testing the API
